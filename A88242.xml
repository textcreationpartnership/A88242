            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Making my appearance (upon Summons) before this Honorable Committee, To Anſwer, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> for publiſhing in Print a Letter which I had ſent unto him.</p>
            <p>And having upon demand, acknowledged the publiſhing thereof, I humbly intreated that I might have the favour, to render the Reaſons of my ſo doing: which you were pleaſed to grant, and to injoyn me to bring them in writing; For which I eſteeme my ſelf farther obliged unto this Honorable Committee.</p>
            <p>Unto whoſe grave Conſiderations I humbly preſent my ſaid Reaſons as followeth.</p>
            <p>Wherein I humbly intreat I may not appear arrogant or vain-glorious, though I enlarge my ſelf in Relation of my own condition and actions, it being a neceſſitie enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon me by my accuſer Mr. <hi>Prinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAy it pleaſe You then to remember, and ſeriouſly to conſider, the manifold afflictions I ſuffered for many yeers under the tyrannicall power of the Biſhops, and Star Chamber: having for defence of the common and juſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this Nation, in oppoſition to the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113028:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 81 -->other exorbitances in things civill and religious; ſuffered a moſt cruell and reproachfull ſentence, and had at leaſt 200 ſtripes: and after that a moſt noyſome and painfull cloſe impriſonment, and ten weeks lying in Irons; being in continuall and reall danger of my life by attempts of ſecret poyſon, open violence, and famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the extreme impairing of my health long after my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>That this Parliament (the hope of the oppreſſed) no ſooner ſate, but as being moſt ſenſible of grievances of that nature, they made it their principall work (as moſt acceptable unto God) to deliver the Captives, and to ſet the oppreſſed free, eſpecially thoſe that had been oppreſſed for Conſcience ſake: Amongſt whom (which I ſhall never forget) this Honorable Parliament were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take me into their firſt and moſt compaſſionate thoughts; and delivered me out of all my troubles.</p>
            <p>And as this their tender compaſſion wrought in all ſorts of conſcientious people a thankfull acknowledgement of their piety and goodneſſe towards tender conſciences, ſo more eſpecially in me as I was a more large partaker of their immediate good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; inſomuch that I with thouſands more were inſtantly ready on all occaſions to adventure our lives in defence of ſo juſt, and pious an Authority: which we frequently and ſucceſſefully teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at Weſtminſter in the moſt dangerous and doubtfull times, to the terror of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Nor did our affections or gratitude coole within us; but as the neceſſities of the Parliament increaſed, and the malice of their enemies introducing new; we forſook all that was dear unto us, and voluntarily betook our ſelves to Arms in their juſt defence. And firſt at <hi>Kienton</hi> Field gave proof of our Conſtancie and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Secondly, at <hi>Brainsford,</hi> where for 5 or 6 houres ſuch a fight was maintained with a handfull of men againſt the Kings Army, as gave check to their fury, and time to further proviſion, and made way to a faire and great opportunity for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments party, as hath been ſeen ſince the warre. In which action many precious friends loſt their lives; and wherein it was my lot to be taken priſoner: in which condition I ſuffered ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull ſcoffs from both great and ſmall in that Army, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113028:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 81 -->inhumane revilings, and unheard uſages that villany could invent, and malice inflict, untill I was brought to Oxford: where after I had, through the aſſiſtance of God, withſtood the temptations of 4 Lords making the largeſt offers of profit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if I would forſake the Parliaments ſervice, and ſerve the King: I was inſtantly thrown into Irons, threatned with death; and arraigned before Judge <hi>Heath</hi> in a moſt reproachfull and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome manner (in all which I bleſſe God I ſtood firm and unſhaken in my faith, and thankfulneſſe to the Honorable<note n="*" place="margin">Although I loſt by my ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in priſon 6 or 700 <abbr>l.</abbr> in my eſtate that I left at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> Parliament) expecting no other then a ſhamefull death: And then alſo was not the Parliament unmindfull of me their Servant and Souldier; but made an Order in my behalf that reſtrained the malice of their proceeding towards me, and exchanged me I moſt thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge upon odds; and in my return I received a large ſupply and reall encouragement from my Honored Lord Generall <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which endeared me ſtill farther to do them the beſt ſervice I was able; whereupon I engaged my ſelf under the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable my Lord of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> in his Northern expeditions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what ſervice ſo performed in taking of Sir <hi>Fra. Wortleys</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Tickell Caſtle, as alſo how I ſuccoured my wounded Souldiers, being wounded my ſelf; and my ſelf disburſed almoſt 30 <abbr>l.</abbr> to cure them, when we had neither Chirurgion nor money from the State: and how I have behaved my ſelf all along in that warre I wiſh might be teſtified by my moſt worthy Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was a daily witneſſe of my actions<note n="*" place="margin">For which Service there is about 600 <abbr>l.</abbr> owing me.</note>.</p>
            <p>And when opportunity gave leave I reſolved to viſit my friends at Weſtminſter and London, expecting a joyfull and cheerfull entertainment, and good acceptation both of my ſelfe and all other the like conſcientious perſons; as being well aſſured that neither I nor they had ever ſhamed our ſelves either by treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, covetouſneſſe, plundering or mutiny, &amp;c. But to my excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grief and aſtoniſhment, I found a very ſad and frowning countenance from moſt of thoſe that formerly had had us in great and good eſteeme; I found all ſorts of conſcientious people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one ſort onely, altogether diſcountenanced and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; and as towards others, ſo alſo towards my ſelf: the City being fill'd with daily relations of ſtrange and very hard uſage
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113028:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 82 -->towards them in all quarters; as that ſome upon pretence of law had been violently carried before Magiſtrates for not hearing Common Prayer, and though known to be neither Papiſts nor Malignants, have been ſent to priſons and common Jayls, Baile being refuſed many, acceſſe of friends denyed, alſo the benefit of writing, kept amongſt theeves and murtherers; not plancks to lye upon, nor food allowed; wives, children, and families periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſuch occaſions. The like hard uſage for meeting together in private houſes to worſhip God: Some have been Indicted and adjudged to be baniſhed, or not obeying to be hanged to death, upon Statutes made in the Prelaticall times of ignorance, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and perſecution; which was hoped would have aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>That others had been as hardly dealt withall upon pretence of Authority of Parliament, as violently ſurpriſed and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many dragged before Officers and Magiſtrates, and thence hurried to priſon, and uſed as aforeſaid: others ſet in the ſtocks, excluded garriſon Towns, thruſt from their habitations, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with baniſhment out of Counties, examined <hi>Ex Officio</hi> againſt themſelves and deareſt friends, and impriſoned for refuſing to anſwer.</p>
            <p>That the Covenant was as earneſtly preſt upon tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, though their faithfulneſſe were no whit doubtfull, as upon Neutrals and Malignants, and refuſing becauſe of ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, put from offices of truſt and publick imployments.</p>
            <p>That rude ignorant people frequently took boldneſſe to break and ſpoil their houſes, threatning to fire them, and to ſtone the people to death; that ſome had been beaten and ſore bruiſed; one had been killed in the place where he was worſhipping God: and many women ſo abuſed as they miſcarried of their children; All which uſages ſo full of hazard and miſchief to good men, can be teſtified by witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like Diſcourſes, may it pleaſe this Honorable Committee, being the hourely complaints of a faithfull religious people, ever deare and pretious to my affections, for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained zeale to God, and ſinceritie to the Parliament, made very ſad and deepe impreſſions upon my ſpirit: ſo as conſidering with

Wherein I found none to exceed or to come neer unto my old fellow-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> from whom I leaſt expected ſuch bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, yea ſo bitter, that truly when I conſidered them, and rightly apprehended the dangers thereof, I was ſo farre from wondering, at the miſerable ſufferings of conſciencious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>I rather wondred that any of us walked the ſtreets in ſafetie.</hi> For though the power of God force him to confeſſe in the firſt page of his Epiſtle to the Parliament, in his book entituled, <hi>Truth triumphing over Falſhood,</hi> that we, for the moſt part are really cordiall in our affections, actions to the Parliament and Church of England (for which, and for our pietie we are (as he ſaith) to be highly honoured) yet immediately after he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make us, our actions and tenents to be deſtructive to the very fundamentall power and being of Parliaments, and as bad or worſe then the Popiſh Gunpowder-plot to blow up the Authority of this high Court, in all ſucceeding ages.

And a little after ſaith, that we contemne and deſpight Authoritie and all humane power whatſoever. And in his Epiſtle to the Reader, page the ſecond, he ſaith, that we are deſtructive to all Chriſtian and humane ſocieties, and bring in meere confuſion and flat Atheiſme amongſt the people. And a little after ſaith, that we diſſolve all relations, ſubordinations, and humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie it ſelfe, being as bad as the Popiſh Monks, Hermites, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites, Nunnes, and Jeſuites, with infinite other moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, monſtrous, provoking, unjuſt, and unſufferable expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which all his books are filled full of.

            <p>The ſerious conſideration of which, exceedingly preſſed me out of that reall love I beare to my Countrey, in a few

               <!-- PDF PAGE 83 -->lines to Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> to diſcover unto him his unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable dealing towards thoſe he falſly calumniateth; and the great diſ-ſervice his bloody lines is likely to do to the whole Kingdome in generall. In dividing the affections of thoſe that formerly were one, till ſuch bitter dividing ſpirits as his kindled a blazing fire of diſcord and diſſenſion amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to every true hearted Engliſhmen that deſires a ſpeedie end of theſe warres, of what evill conſequence it would be to the Parliament and Kingdome, to have ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſiderable a party as Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> calumniateth, and reproacheth as bad if not worſe then ever the Biſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury did, ſhould be cauſleſly cut off with the Sword, or be diſ-ingaged by his meanes (eſpecially ſeeing the Kingdomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities is ſuch that they ſtand in need of the help of forrainers) of all which people whom he reproacheth as Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, I am confident he is not able to tax any one of them with unfaithfulneſſe to the Parliament, nor with cowardlineſſe, or any other baſeneſſe in the Service. And for my part I profeſſe, I know not one of that generation in <hi>England</hi> that ever drew his Sword one houre for the King or his party againſt the Parliament and theirs: and if Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> know any, I deſire him to declare it.</p>
            <p>Now moſt Noble and worthy Senators, is it not a ſad thing that it ſhould be a crime in that man who being ſenſible of theſe bloody, unchriſtian and dividing practiſes in Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> uſ'd meanes to inform him thereof, and endeavoured by a free debate with him (which I offered him in my letter) to convince and reclaim him from making further progreſſe in incenſing Magiſtracy againſt thoſe that are faithfull and ſucceſſefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their preſervation, to leave the publick Service as in the prelaticall time for oppreſſion of conſcience, in ſo much as I could not forbear.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons which mov'd me to ſend my Letter to Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> which I humbly offer and ſubmit to the grave Judgement of this Honorable Committee, being reſolved that no provocations from any man ſhall ſlack my wonted faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to my diſtreſſed Countrey.</p>
